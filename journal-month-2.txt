Premise:
By some clerical error in WaterlooWorks, our protagonist got an offer from a big tech company as a Junior Software Developer. 
They know they are surely under-qualified, but what-the-hey, the proposition for free meals and unlimited snacks meant the offer was accepted anyways!  
They have now been working at this company for 1 month, and they might be starting to get the hang of things.
Write a day’s entry in their journal, as our protagonist fakes it till they make it!

Day 1:

Dear Diary,
What am i doing here, why would they pick me??? Are their standards that low lol? Whatever, they have free food that's all that matters
