Premise:
By some clerical error in WaterlooWorks, our protagonist got an offer from a big tech company as a Junior Software Developer. 
They know they are surely under-qualified, but what-the-hey, the proposition for free meals and unlimited snacks meant the offer was accepted anyways!  
They have now been working at this company for 1 month, and they might be starting to get the hang of things.
Write a day’s entry in their journal, as our protagonist fakes it till they make it!

## Day 10

Dear Diary,

Oh man, I have no idea what's happening at work..... All i do is eat the free food. So i decided to go to UW Coffee n' Code's GitHub workshop so that I could actually learn something!
