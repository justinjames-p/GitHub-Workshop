Tonight, we will all be contributing to an “open source” story! No programming required and have fun writing!

## Story Prompt
By some clerical error in WaterlooWorks, our protagonist got an offer from a big tech company as a Junior Software Developer. They know they are surely under-qualified, but what-the-hey, the proposition for free meals and unlimited snacks meant the offer was accepted anyways!  Write an day’s entry in their journal, as our protagonist fakes it till they make it!

## Instructions Checklist
1.	If you do not have a Github account, [follow this guide to create one](resources/github_signup_instructions.md).

2.	[Enter your name](http://bit.ly/2C3XZ0t) next to the day you want to write for in our protagonist’s diary.

3.	[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5grYMXbAV0) on how to fork a repository, then fork the Coffee ‘N Code “GitHub-Workshop” repo.

4.	[Watch the first 2 min of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVQK2zzb6U8) on how to make a new branch and commit changes to your forked repo. Don't make a pull request yet! Also, don't make changes to master (which happens after 2min in the video)

5. Create a branch with a name structured “day#” with the day you chose in step 2.

6. Within this branch, write a diary entry using [this template](resources/diary_entry_template.md), and commit your change.
